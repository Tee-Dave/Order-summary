## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Visual studio code
- [Downloaded Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For fonts

### What I learned

```html
<div class="empty"></div>
```

```css
.plan-type::first-line {
  font-weight: var(--fontWeight3);
}
```

```css
:root {
  --PimarypaleBlue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
  --PrimarybrightBlue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
  --NeutralveryPaleblue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
  --Neutraldesaturatedblue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
  --darkBlue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
  --fontsizeparagraph: 16px;
  --fontFamily: redhat;
  --fontWeight1: 500;
  --fontWeight2: 700;
  --fontWeight3: 900;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan on working on my css more as I am still not conversant with a lot of css properties.

### Useful resources

- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me understand grids more and i also got a lot of peoples perspective on grids.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US) - This is an amazing website which helped me understand the minmax property in grids. If you have any problems with that topic do check this site out.
